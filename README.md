# Project Overview


## Background
The objective of this project was to determine the number of retirement-eligible employees based on their birth dates, job titles, employment dates. and number of retiring employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to train employees getting ready for retirement. The new mentoring program will help to retain experienced and successful employees that want to step back into a part-time role instead of retiring completely. Their new role in the company would be as a mentor to newly hired employees.

## Deliverables
There were two deliverables for this analysis project:

    1. To determine the number of retiring employees per title
    2. To identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program

## Scope
This analysis evaluated data from various CSV files containing information about departments, department managers, employees, employees associated to different departments, employee titles, and salaries. As part of the analysis, queries were created to retrieve various information about:
    
    * The number of employees by their most recent job titles who are approaching retiring
    * The number of titles filled by employees who are retiring
    * 

employees, their titles, employment datesf rom these files to determine the number of retiring employes. In order to determine the count of employees eligible for retirement, the project involved creating database tables to store the data from the CSV files imported and joining various tables on primary keys and constraints to retrieve information from specific columns in those table.

The data was furtther filtered by different conditions, such as employees who were born between the 1952 and 1955, the number of employees by their most recent job title who are nearing retirement, the number of titles filled by employees who are retiring, and other queries to  The query results were then stored in new tables formed
