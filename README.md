# Project Overview


## Project Purpose
The objective of this project was to determine the number of retirement-eligible employees based on birth dates and job titles and number of retiring employees that are eligible to participate in a mentorship program to train employees getting ready for retirement. The new mentoring program will help to retain experienced and successful employees that want to step back into a part-time role instead of retiring completely. Their new role in the company would be as a mentor to newly hired employees.

## Project Scope
This analysis evaluated data from various CSV files containing information about departments, department managers, employees, employees associated to different departments, employee titles, and their salaries. As part of the analysis, queries were created to retrieve various information from these files, create database tables, join various tables on primary keys and constraints. The data was then filtered by different conditions, such as the titles for employees
